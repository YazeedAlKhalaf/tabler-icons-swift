import UIKit

let image: UIImage = TablerIcons.appleFilled
```

For macOS, the NSImage extension offers a static function that fetches images by their Tabler name from the moduleâ€™s bundle:

```swift
import AppKit

let image: NSImage = TablerIcons.appleFilled
```

## Usage for SwiftUI

```swift
import SwiftUI
import TablerIcons

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(nsImage: TablerIcons.appleFilled) // For macOS
            Image(uiImage: TablerIcons.appleFilled) // For iOS
            Text("Hello, Tabler Icons!")
        }
    }
}
```
